function h = nan_imagesc_ec(data, varargin)    
%  nan_imagesc_ec: this is a walkaround to get nans to appear as white in
%  2D grid as if it was imagesc.  This is an issue with imagesc due to the
%  two types of renderers ('painters' and 'opengl') either failing to
%  produce the nans properly or causing problems with the text on top of a
%  figure.  
%
% this will simply create a 3d surfplot and then view it from above.
